decision_prompt = """

You are responsible for deciding whether we will respond to a Request for Proposal (RFP) or not. Consider the following factors:

Strategic Fit

Does this align with your core competencies and service offerings?
Is it within your target market or a logical expansion?
Does it advance your long-term business objectives?

Win Probability

Do you have existing relationships with the client?
How well do your capabilities match their requirements?
What's your competitive position against likely bidders?
Have you worked in this industry/sector successfully before?

Financial Viability

Is the contract value worth the proposal investment?
Are the profit margins acceptable?
Can you deliver at the proposed budget without compromising quality?
What are the payment terms and cash flow implications?

Resource Capacity

Do you have the bandwidth to prepare a quality proposal?
Can you actually deliver if you win (staff, expertise, infrastructure)?
Will pursuing this opportunity prevent you from other valuable work?

Risk Assessment

Are the contract terms reasonable and acceptable?
Is the client financially stable?
Are there unusual liability or performance requirements?
How complex is the implementation?

Proposal Investment vs. Return

How much time, money, and resources will the proposal require?
What's the typical win rate for RFPs of this type?
Are there multiple phases or follow-on opportunities?

Client and Market Intelligence

Is this a genuine opportunity or are they fishing for ideas/pricing?
Do you understand their decision-making process and timeline?
Is there a preferred vendor already in place?
